            <p>
                Visual Utility Technological Aid is an Electronic Travel Aid (ETA) designed to help the visually impaired avoid obstacles with the help of digital camera that foresees the object and collision in front of the impaired person serving as the temporary eyes for the blind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The device's design is encased in an old virtual reality headset where the Raspberry Pi executes all the devices' action such as collision detection and object identification and enumeration through the tiny camera

                <h2>Visual Utility Technological Aid was built to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide assistance to people who experience vision-related issues. Primarily permanently blind persons</li>
                <li>A rechargeable and portable automatic real-time object detector with voice output to provide assistance to the users in identifying objects ahead of them using a microprocessor.</li>
                <li>Implement build-in text-to-speech or audio feedback functions. In order to walk independently, people with visual impairments will thereafter be able to recognize objects that the device has detected. The device's camera and ultrasonic sensor will turn on right away and start scanning the area around the users' immediate surrounds for things and obstructions in their route.</li>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    The conception of the idea of V.U.T.A. was a result of one of the researchers undergoing laser eye surgery. He was inspired by a customer from the clinic prior to his operation. Due to his extroverted nature, he had a conversation with a visually impaired man who told him about the struggles of impaired vision. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it turns out, he was finding ideas to be used for thesis and had the idea of a wearable goggles that could help the blind navigate his environment in order to avoid accidents that were avoidable with healthy vision. He also considered the reuse of materials to incorporate resourcefulness and save costs using old electronics such as an empty VR headset, electronic wires, an old Raspberry Pi Cam and a 4 pack battery slot.
