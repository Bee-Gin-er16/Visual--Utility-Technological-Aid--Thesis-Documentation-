# Visual  Utility Technological Aid (Thesis Documentation)
 This is a portfolio website to showcase our thesis for recruiters looking into our previous thesis. Will only serve as display purposes and WILL NOT incude CODE USED in Thesis (Unanimous agreement of the group to keep code private). Not yet hosted or put photos. Still in HTML form after finalizing designs

DEVICE FUNCTIONS:
- Detect and recognize household objects for the blind person
- Detect incoming hazards during movement towards an incoming hazard
- Outputs a text-to-speech voice identifying the object that is within the field of view of the wearer
- The device is able to run within 1 hour after being fully charged

PURPOSE:
- To design a device that could help blind people navigate and serve as secondary eyes
- Help blind people avoid potential hazards when walking
- Relay to the user, via text-to-speech, the noun of the object that he/she is looking at when using the device.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Machine learning model was from an open source. We couldn't train our own model due to current PC limitations
- Object identification may not always be accurate but it can only be close to accurate.
- Battery limitations
- Machine learning with OpenCV cannot identify an object's common noun but not the proper noun . (ie: phone(common noun) => Iphone 5(proper noun))

Award won from this project:
- 2nd Place in the oral category at the Cebu Institute of Technology University's 12th Research Congress
